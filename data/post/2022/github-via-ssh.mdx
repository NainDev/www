Dont need if you use github desktop ~

I do this all the time whenever I break my Arch install (ye I have my backups in timeshift, dont teach me now) or I do another distro hop, so thought why not I just put these in my easy website to easy access these commands, instead of typing them always :p 

1. Open terminal and cd into ssh folder (mkdir ~/.ssh if it doesnt exist there )
```bash 
cd ~/.ssh
```
2. Update with your GitHub Email Address 
```bash 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "itsag0024@gmail.com"
```
Ignore passphrase (by press Enter key without input any characters) if you want to create a non-passphrase ssh key

3. Run ssh agent
```bash 
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
 ```
4. Add the key has been just generated to ssh agent
you can simply run (if you are folllowing my guide) 
```bash 
ssh-add
```
else
```bash
ssh-add "/home/username/.ssh/ssh_file_name"
 ```
5. Copy the SSH Key by 
```bash 
ls
cat id_rsa.pub
```
(Dont copy mine, I have changed it alr :p)

**Finally,**
 
Add the publickey to github account (go to "Setting" then select "SSH and GPG keys")
