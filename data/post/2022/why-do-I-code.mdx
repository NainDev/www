I'm not saying that being a 17yr old guy who have to manage his high school, assigmenets, exams, studying, coding projects and his own newsletter is been always hard for me but it is really hard especially when you have distractions of life. Sometimes I would just rather be playing video games or hanging out with my friends than doing homework or studying for an exam but I learned that if you want to get somewhere in life then you need to make sacrifices sometimes.

I knew that if i dropped my hobbies my grades will suffer because of the lack of motivation, so instead of dropping all my hobbies i decided to be very smart about it. I still coded a few times a week and i continued writing articles for my newsletter but instead of doing all these things during weekends or after school hours i did them in 2 hours every day where i could do whatever i wanted and since coding was really fun for me it was easy for me to spend those two hours on it. During those two hours i did not only code, but i also spent a lot of time learning about coding. I read books that were related to what i was doing and they helped me learn more about it.

I spent those two hours trying out new things and learning from my mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes while coding, but it was worth it because i learned more about programming by doing this than if i just watched videos or read books about it.

I also tried to have a goal in mind when i was coding. It could be anything like "I want to learn how to make an app that will show the weather" or "I want to understand what happens under the hood when i click this button".

I tried to focus on the goal and not get frustrated when i made mistakes. This made it easier for me to learn new things because i wasn't distracted by how hard it was or how long it took. I also set small goals that i could accomplish in one sitting so that my motivation didn't run out halfway through the day. It's easy to get discouraged when you realize that you haven't made any progress on something that you thought would only take a few hours.
