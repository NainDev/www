> As of August 2022, I am a 17yr old, 12th grader high school student from India, aspiring to be a doctor 👨‍⚕️, and continue my hobby of coding, learning new skills and building things alongside.

## What I'm doing now
👨🏼‍⚕️ 1. I'm currently studying for my Class 12th Boards and NEET (Medical Entrance Test India), and also for few state entrance exams. <br/>
🎬 2. I'm trying my best to make time to start a YouTube channel, where I can upload about tech, productivity and coding stuff. But still it's hard to manage all these along my studies 😢. <br/>
💌 3. I have started writing a weekly email newsletter. Each Friday, I share some thoughts about subjects I've been pondering, along with links to books, articles and podcasts that I've been enjoying. Check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe 😉 <br/>

## Other Stuff
🎼 1. I love listening to music, share me your favourite spotify playlist, I'll give it a like and can even follow you. <br/>
🙌 2. I have great plans to achieve in my life, Just working hard to achieve them, read more about them here. <br/>
