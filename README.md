## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

Beyond technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life.
It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment on what I wrote.
